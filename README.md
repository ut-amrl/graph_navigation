## Build

1. Add the project directory to `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`:
    ```
    export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=MYDIRECTORY:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
    ```
    (Replace `MYDIRECTORY` with the actual directory)
    You can also add this to your `~/.bashrc` file so that you don't have to do
    this every time you open a new terminal.
1. Build the program:
    ```
    make
    ```
    Optionally, to compile on all cores (make sure you have sufficient RAM!)
    ```
    make -j
    ```
1. Do **not** run `cmake`, `catkin_make`, `rosbuild`.

## Run

Run `./bin/navigation`
